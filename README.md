## Project Overview

The Rock Paper Scissors Game is an interactive website that allows users to play the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a score of 5 wins. This project serves as a demonstration of my skills in writing JavaScript game logic, manipulating the DOM, and providing an engaging user experience.

The website features a user-friendly interface with intuitive game controls, a score display, and a clear indication of the first-to-5 winning condition. Users can make their hand gesture selection by clicking on the respective buttons, and the computer's choice will be displayed. The game outcome will be determined, and the score will be updated accordingly. The first player to reach 5 wins will be declared the winner.

## Getting Started

To play the Rock Paper Scissors game, simply visit the live demo at [sebiram-rps.vercel.app](https://sebiram-rps.vercel.app) in your web browser.

Interact with the game by making hand gesture selections and observe the computer's choices. The game outcome will be displayed, and the score will be updated based on the results. Strive to be the first player to reach 5 wins and claim victory!
